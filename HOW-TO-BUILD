This how-to is based to work on any Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based distros in 64-bit mode.

Download required tools:
1. Download tool for unpack/repack ramdisk "AIK-Linux" from https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-android-image-kitchen-unpack-repack-kernel-ramdisk-win-android-linux-mac.2073775/
2. Downlaod toolchain "gcc-arm-8.3-2019.03-x86_64-aarch64-linux-gnu" from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads/8-3-2019-03

3. Unpack a2n_kernel_g950x_9.x.zip to your HOME folder and don't change the structure of the files.
4. Put the unpacked toolchain and AIK-Linux to your HOME folder.
5. Grab the boot.img from "a2n_kernel_g950x_9.x" and copy it to the root folder of AIK-Linux
6. Open a new terminal emulator in the AIK folder and unpack ramdisk:
./unpackimg.sh --nosudo

7. Open a new terminal emulator and download the source code:
git clone https://github.com/ace2nutzer/Samsung_dreamlte_Kernel.git
cd Samsung_dreamlte_Kernel

8. Check the scripts:
clean.sh
edit_kernel_g950x.sh
build_kernel_g950x.sh
and adjust variables to your own.

9. # cleanup source tree
./clean.sh

10. # edit kernel (enabled or disable drivers)
./edit_kernel_g950x.sh

11. # build kernel and create a flashable zip-file for e.g. TWRP
./build_kernel_g950x.sh

If the compilation will run without any errors, it'll give you a "a2n_kernel_g950x_9.x_user_build.zip" in the folder "a2n_kernel_g950x_9.x"

### HOW TO FIX BUILD ERRORS ###
e.g. if you get error: git: command not found or similar, then simply install the missing packages like this:
open a new terminal emulator and install missing "git" tool:
sudo apt-get install git

### NOTE ###
You are only allowed to download, edit, build and use the generated zip-file ONLY FOR YOUR OWN USAGE.
!! DO NOT RESTRIBUTE !!
